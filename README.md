This project is intended to optimize the given list of chemical compounds.
Somehow my girlfriend research has to optimize so many things (around 350 chemical compounds)
by hand manually, by opening the program, click here and there, save it to other 
formats (`mol2` & `pdb`). Thanks Marvin!

## Run

I still don't have a time to make it as GUI or command line support.
You need a CSV file contains the compounds in `SMILES` format and put it in resource folder.
Then, you have to run it on an IDE (e.g. IntelliJ). See the `export` directory to see
the result files.
